# MinecraftProject
A fun project over the weekend

# How to run
Steps:
0. Clone the repository
1. Run MinecraftProject/Minecraft Tools/Minecraft Tools/Install_API.bat
2. Run MinecraftProject/Minecraft Tools/Minecraft Tools/Start_Server.Ink
3. Run convert_csv_to_minecraft.py

I will be adding argparse soon so that users can add their own csv file and desired locations for the csv files to be mapped to.
Have fun.
